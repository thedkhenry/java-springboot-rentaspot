## Case Study: Parking Spot Rental and Management

### Goal:
To allow users to locate, reserve, and rent out parking spaces. The app will connect hosts who want to rent out their 
unused space with guests seeking to station vehicles safely at affordable prices. Guests will be able to find the right 
listing using a variety of filters and a booking system that would allow them to reserve a parking space through any available dates.
